# scripts
A collection of scripts I've written for random parts of my life.

## ical_to_xlsx
This script roughly mimics what the website https://www.gcal2excel.com/ does for a Google Calendar: takes a specific time range and exports all events within that range in that calendar as a .xlsx file with date, name, and duration.
